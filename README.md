# Expensed
Expensed is a web application that allows users to track their expenses. A user can add, edit, delete, reimburse expenses.

## Technology
HTML5
CSS3
Javascript
Angular.js

## Design
I approached the design with a minimalistic style. Keeping the width of the window small so the user isn't over saturated with to much white space. The color scheme was heavily thought out and meant to be inviting and friendly. The input fields are styled to be fun as well as functional, if the user doesn't input any text an error will pop up and let them know what they should be typing.

## Known Issues
Data should be stored on a service.
